# Graphics and Animation Demo
 
This project was created by me as part of an assignment for a 12-week module on a Computer Science course. This is the result of work completed by me and two other team members. Each team member picked one mission. I chose to do graphical representation (particles). The project uses THREE.js and has been tested on Google Chrome. You will need Apache to run this program, the team used WAMP Server.

Graphical variety and quality were the only two things that received marks.

I really enjoyed working on this project. It provided ample opportunity to enhance my understanding of graphics programming. The team worked very well together. I am very happy with what we achieved.

Files that I created:
index.php
CSS/index.css
js/TextureManager.js
src/BloodParticles.js
src/DrawBridgeAnimation.js
src/Fire.js
src/FireSmoke.js
src/Firework.js
src/Rain.js
src/TextureLoader.js

src/main.js was worked on by all three group members.

Controls:
- Camera pan: Arrow keys or hold RMB and drag
- Rotate camera: Hold LMB and drag
- Open & close drawbridge: F or left click on the lever
- Toggle rain: R
